# Cyber-GSSL

This project has a framework *randomwalk.py* that serves as a skeleton for the 
label propagation model. 

The TensorFlow implementation of the paper *Neural Graph Machines: Learning Neural Networks Using Graphs (Bui, Ravi, Ramavajjala)* is described in **gell_estimator.py**. 

This was created by Christopher Kang at PNNL as his summer 2018 project. He is going to the University of Washington for Computer Science and will start his freshman year in the fall of 2018.
